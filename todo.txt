TODO:

Work on optimizing rendering (Think about something other than swing?) (Try making a movie?)
Make a more robust center calculation from triangles, for rectangles
Optimize getPolys by not recalculating normals
Optimize lighting by introducing a cutoff distance (or dist squared)

See if it is faster to only clip entire polygons or to clip verticies
